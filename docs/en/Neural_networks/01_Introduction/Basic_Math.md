# Basic Math Courses

Before diving into neural networks, it's highly beneficial to have a strong foundation in higher mathematics. While not strictly necessary to begin your journey, having a solid grasp of the following subjects will greatly enhance your understanding and ability to work with neural networks.

If you haven't yet studied these topics in depth, don't worry! You can still proceed with your neural network studies and revisit these mathematical foundations as needed. The courses listed below provide excellent resources for either refreshing your knowledge or learning these subjects from scratch.
